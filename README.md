# BLOCKCHAIN-ASSISTED-QUANTUM-IMAGES-FOR-EARLY-DISEASE-DETECTION-AND-TRUSTWORTHY-DATA-STORAGE

Blockchain-Assisted Quantum Imaging
A Secure Framework for Next-Generation Medical Diagnostics

1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

Medical imaging is a vital tool in modern healthcare, allowing non-invasive visualization of internal structures. Technologies like X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and PET have transformed diagnostics.
However, classical imaging is limited by diffraction barriers, radiation risks, and sensitivity constraints.

This project explores Quantum Imaging — leveraging quantum mechanics for high-resolution imaging — and combines it with Blockchain technology to ensure secure, immutable medical data management.

1.2 Challenges in Classical Imaging

Limited resolution due to diffraction

Risk from ionizing radiation

Data fragmentation across systems (EHR, PACS, LIS)

High costs due to late-stage diagnosis

1.3 Motivation

The project aims to:

Use Quantum Imaging for ultra-sensitive diagnostics

Use Blockchain for secure, decentralized data storage

Integrate Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for future-proof security

Empower patients through smart-contract–based access control

2. Literature Review
   
2.1 Quantum Imaging

Quantum imaging uses entangled photons and photon correlations to achieve sub-diffraction-limit resolution.
Examples:

Ghost Imaging – image reconstruction through entangled photon pairs

Quantum Illumination – enhanced detection in noisy environments

Formula:
I(A:B) = H(A) + H(B) − H(AB)

Parameter	Classical	Quantum
Light Source	Continuous beam	Entangled photons
Resolution	Diffraction-limited	Sub-diffraction
Radiation	High	Minimal
SNR	Moderate	Very High

2.2 Blockchain Principles

Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger.

Decentralization eliminates single points of failure

Immutability ensures tamper-proof records

Transparency provides full audit trails

Healthcare requires a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) for privacy compliance.

2.3 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Classical cryptography (RSA, ECC) will be broken by future quantum computers.
PQC introduces quantum-resistant algorithms such as:

Algorithm	Type	Basis	Use
CRYSTALS-Kyber	Lattice	Module-LWE	Key Exchange
Dilithium	Lattice	Module-LWE	Digital Signatures
Falcon	Lattice	NTRU	Lightweight Signatures
SPHINCS+	Hash-based	Collision Resistance	Verification

3. System Design and Methodology

3.1 Architecture Overview

Quantum Image Acquisition

Image Processing and Feature Extraction

AI/ML Disease Diagnosis

Blockchain Data Storage and Access

3.2 Workflow

Acquire (quantum) medical image

Preprocess and extract features

Diagnose via trained AI model

Hash and record results on blockchain

Formula:
Image Hash = SHA256(Pixel Matrix)

3.3 Image Processing (Module 2)

Steps:

Convert to grayscale

Resize to 128x128

Normalize pixels

Flatten into 1D vector

Code Snippet (Python):

gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
resized = cv2.resize(gray_image, (128, 128))
normalized = resized / 255.0
features = normalized.flatten()

3.4 AI/ML Diagnosis (Module 3)

Uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification (Normal vs Pneumonia).
Synthetic dataset generated using make_classification().

Metrics:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

3.5 Blockchain Storage (Module 4)

Stores hashes and metadata, not raw images.
Uses off-chain storage for image files (e.g., IPFS).

Block Structure:

Index | Timestamp | Transactions | Prev_Hash | Nonce | Hash


Hash Formula:

B_hash = SHA256(Block Data + Nonce)

4. Tools and Technologies

Tool	Purpose
Python 3	Main programming language
OpenCV	Image preprocessing
NumPy	Numerical operations
Scikit-learn	Machine learning (SVM)
hashlib	SHA-256 hashing
Matplotlib / Seaborn	Visualization
JSON	Data serialization

5. Results

The proof-of-concept (proco.py) successfully executed the end-to-end workflow.

A simulated X-ray was processed, classified, and securely stored on a blockchain block.

The system proved the feasibility of combining AI-driven diagnostics with blockchain verification.
